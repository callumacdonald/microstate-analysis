EEG analysis scripts for Cambridge Part II Psychology Project

Code should be run in MATLAB R2019b using the EEGLAB plugin. EEGLAB is available from here: https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download.php

Data is available upon request. 

Once EEG data has been loaded into EEGLAB, create a processedData object from the data using processedData(EEG)
This will push the data through the whole processing pipeline.
